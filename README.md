# Docker Workshop

This repo holds the code that will be used during the [HELIX](http://helix.uchicago.edu/) analysis workshop at OSU. 

The subdirectories will focus on specific aspects of the workshop, with the `README.md` files acting as an introduction and cheatsheet:
* [Docker Run Example](./docker_run_example/README.md): This directory will go through the basics of container lifetimes, mainly centered around the `docker pull`, `docker run`, `docker stop` and `docker rm` commands.
* [Docker Build Example](./docker_build_example/README.md): This directory will go through the basics of building custom images from `Dockerfile`.
* [Docker Compose Example](./docker_compose_example/README.md): This directory will go through the basics of `docker compose`, allowing one to deploy multiple containers with a simple yaml file.
